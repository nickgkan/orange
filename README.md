Code for our paper ''Orientation Attentive Robot Grasp Synthesis''.

 **Abstract:** 
Physical neighborhoods of grasping points in common objects may offer a wide variety of plausible grasping configurations. For a fixed center of a simple spherical object for example, there is an infinite number of valid grasping orientations. Such structures create ambiguous and discontinuous grasp maps that confuse neural regressors. We perform a thorough investigation on the challenging Jacquard dataset to show that the existing pixel-wise learning approaches are prone to box overlaps of drastically different orientations. We then introduce a novel augmented map representation that partitions the angle space into bins to allow for the co-occurrence of such orientations and observe larger accuracy margins on the ground truth grasp map reconstructions. On top of that, we build the ORientation AtteNtive Grasp synthEsis (ORANGE) framework that jointly solves a bin classification problem and a real-value regression. The grasp synthesis is attentively supervised by combining discrete and continuous estimations into a single map. We provide experimental evidence by appending ORANGE to two existing unimodal architectures and boost their performance to state-of-the-art levels on Jacquard, specifically 94.71\%, over all related works, even multimodal.

## Requirements
Tested with Python 3.5 and 3.6.
Tested Pytorch versions: >=1.0.1
See requirements.txt!
```
pip -r install requirements.txt
```

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/nickgkan/orange.git
cd orange
```
2. Download Jacquard/Cornell datasets.
3. Edit DATA_FOLDER in config.py, providing the path where your dataset is stored.
By default, the code expects a folder 'jacquard' or 'cornell' inside DATA_FOLDER (config.py).
4. Transform annotations and create project folders.
```
python prepare_data.py DATASET
```
where DATASET can be either 'jacquard' or 'cornell'


## Train/test a model
```
python main.py --dataset=DATASET --model=MODEL
```
See main.py for other input arguments.
Also see config.py for choices on dataset and task arguments.
To train/test our best model:
```
python main.py --dataset=jacquard --model=unet --use_bin_loss --use_bin_attention_loss --use_graspness_loss
```
